# Open science and the future university researcher

This white paper was written as a contribution to the
["Imagining Tomorrow's University: Rethinking scholarship, education, and
institutions for an open, networked era"
workshop](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/Conferences/ImagineU/), a
joint NIH/NSF-funded event held 8â€“9 March 2017 in Rosemont, IL.
In this paper, I present an overview of what I consider open science,
its importance, and how it plays a role in my research agenda.
I also discuss challenges faced in pursuing research openness, and
recommend changes to university leaders to address these barriers.
